Feature requests/future plans:
- add support for cycle (skip every n note), and skip (randomly miss notes)
- add up/down/up-down directions
- add free/sort/synch modes

Known bugs:
- restart doesn't always start exactly on the beat (need synch mode)

Fixed:

- starts one arp step too late
- cannot restart after pause in the middle of a note (playback)
  Not an error. If you start playback in a middle on a note there is no note-on command
- bpm changes not detected properly when changed in a sequencer session
- need to add midi note off for gate
- need to add major and minor chords
